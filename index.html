                        <p><small> Its a privately owned company founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The private spaceflight company SpaceX is the first company ever to build and launch its own rockets and space capsules to the International Space Station and return them to Earth. SpaceX's unmanned Dragon space capsules launch on the company's Falcon 9 rockets and first flew to the International Space Station in 2012. The Hawthorne, Califonia based company is planning to upgrade Dragon capsules to launch seven people into orbit in upcoming years, but there's more to SpaceX than meets the eye.</small></p>
                        <h3 class="text-primary"><u>Facts</u></h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Names</strong>: SpaceX's billionaire CEO Elon Musk has said that he named his spacecraft "Dragon" after the fictional "Puff the Magic Dragon," from the hit song by music group Peter, Paul and Mary. Musk said he used the name because many critics considered his goals impossible when he founded SpaceX in 2002. </li>
                            <li><strong>2013</strong>: In 2013, the company celebrated its 10th anniversary and secured a $1.6 billion deal with NASA to provide 12 unmanned cargo flights to the International Space Station. Another company, Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corp., is also under contract with the agency to provide supply flights to the orbiting lab</li>
                            <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: On the Dragon capsule's first test flight in December 2010, it carried a wheel of cheese into orbit. Prior to the successful liftoff, SpaceX officials hinted that Dragon was carrying special cargo into space, but the company did not reveal the secret payload until after the spacecraft had returned from orbit and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean.</li>
                            <li><strong>Falcon</strong>: SpaceX's fleet of Falcon rockets — the Falcon 9 boosters and smaller Falcon 1 rockets — are named after the fictional Millenium Falcon spaceship from creator George Lucas' "Star Wars" movies. In the sci-fi classics, the iconic Millenium Falcon spacecraft is commanded by the character Han Solo</li>
